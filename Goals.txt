Goals for December:
Design a Webpage
	-Make a general layout
	-Make a couple of generic pages i.e. Accounts page, maybe login? (Will work on backend once page layout is complete)
Put animations and shit, and go full out
Figure out how to make an encrypted database for usernames and passwords with the use of hashing
Probably try and get a certificate through the use of let'scencrypt so I don't have to go through a CA
Get it up and running, and get some people on Server for Lads UwU to beta test it
